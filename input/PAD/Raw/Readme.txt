Each river folder contains raw PT data from the reach. In the "WSE" folder, data from each river are compiled into four options:

1) raw: original PT data
2) corr: PT data organized from upstream to downstream in columns
3) baro_corr: PT data with levels corrected by nearby baro
4) PPP_corr: PT data corrected with PPP data from gps aboard the motor boat (this is the water surface elevation)
